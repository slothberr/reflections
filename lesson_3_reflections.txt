When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

=== FORKS, CLONES AND BRANCHES ===
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 
Forks: Copying someone else's repository on GitHub and don't want to make any changes on theirs
Clones: Copying reposity + commits (local and remote)
Branches: Only done on local repository
